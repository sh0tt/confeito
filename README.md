Confeito, simple and modern micro webframework

* What is confeito?

Confeito is a micro webframework for java based on T2 web framework.
Confeito is designed to use at cloud environment, so Confeito keeps as much as simple and small we can.


* What is the problem of existing java frameworks?

We see there are some problems existing java frameworks.
First, these are very complicated and it seems not needed such complicated abstraction.
Just make a framework simple, and it is enough for us.

Second, the dependencies to other libralies are unlikely fit to cloud environment, 
because cloud environment sometimes needed to be very resource concious like Google App Engine.
So we don't want any other library dependency unless we absolutely need.

Third and last, configuration is just hell, just hell.
We are tired of configuration such as xml, yaml, or whatever.Just tired.
Don't give me these configurations unless we absolutely need and keep work well with default configuration.
